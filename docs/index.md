## Multivariate Analysis of Sensor Data for Study Room Occupancy Estimation

## Introduction

Finding an available study room on campus is often a challenging and time-consuming task for students. The current approach requires physically checking multiple rooms to determine their occupancy status, which can be inefficient, especially when specific amenities are needed. Building upon my previous work in a distributed systems class—where we developed a system to detect study room occupancy to enhance student life—this project delves into the statistical aspects of occupancy estimation.

By analyzing multivariate sensor data, I aim to understand the complex relationships among various environmental factors such as temperature, light intensity, sound levels, and CO₂ concentration. This project not only contributes to the development of an effective occupancy detection system but also provides insights into how different environmental variables interact in occupied versus unoccupied spaces.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to employ multivariate statistical methods to analyze sensor data for estimating study room occupancy levels. Specifically, we aim to:

- Explore and understand the multivariate relationships among different sensor readings.
- Reduce the dimensionality of the dataset using techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most significant factors influencing occupancy.
- Apply Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) to determine if there are statistically significant differences in sensor readings across different occupancy levels.
- Compare different methodological approaches (e.g., PCA vs. sensor type averaging) to identify the most effective strategy for occupancy estimation.

## Research Question

How can multivariate statistical analysis of environmental sensor data be used to accurately estimate study room occupancy levels, and which environmental factors are most significant in predicting occupancy?
